            <p><strong>The Air Jordan 1 was designed by Peter Moore. The Air Jordan 1 was first released in 1985, in a red and black colorway to match the uniform of the Chicago Bulls, the team for which Michael Jordan played.</strong></p>
            <p>This red and black color-way was later outlawed by NBA Commissioner <em>David Stern</em> for not having any white on them. <em>Michael Jordan</em> would wear the shoes anyway, and each time he stepped on the court with the <em>Air Jordan</em> 1 he would be fined five thousand dollars. <em>Nike</em> used this as a promotional tool in advertisements hinting that the shoes gave an unfair competitive advantage and that whoever wore them had a certain edginess associated with outlaw activities.<em>Nike</em> would later create a colorway with red, white, and black which would be worn by <em>Jordan</em> for most of the 1985 and 1986 season.</p>

            <p>The <em>Air Jordan</em> I was originally released from 1985 to 1986. It was retroed in 1994, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014.</p>
            <p>Although the <em>AJ</em> 1 lacked technology, the colors and cultural significance set the sneaker industry on its ear. The <em>Air Jordan</em> 1 paved the way for colorful basketball sneakers. It transformed the way people looked at athletic shoes. During the 1985 NBA season, Michael wore the <em>Air Jordan</em> 1, which retailed for $65 - at the time, the most expensive basketball shoe on the market. The <em>AJ</em> I Black/Red colorway was banned by the NBA because of rules regarding shoe colors; Jordan was fined $5,000 for every game he wore them (Nike gladly footed the bill, as the fines created even more buzz around the <em>Air Jordan 1</em>). <em>MJ's</em> rookie campaign resulted in an <em>All-Star</em> appearance, Rookie of the Year honors and leading the <em>Bulls</em> to the playoffs after a four-year absence. <em>Michael</em> wore the <em>Air Jordan </em>I Red/White/Black as he scored 63 points against the <em>Boston Celtics</em> in the 1986 playoffs. Although the Bulls ended up losing to the <em>Larry Bird-led Celtics, Michael</em> showed that he was one of the bright young stars in the <em>NBA</em>.</p>
